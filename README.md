# Bitcoin Address Clustering

A comprehensive implementation of Bitcoin address clustering using multiple heuristic conditions for blockchain analysis and chain analysis applications.

## Abstract

This project extracts information from the Bitcoin blockchain to create transaction graphs and perform chain analysis through Bitcoin address clustering. The main goal is to group Bitcoin addresses that likely belong to the same entity using various heuristic methods, enabling better understanding of Bitcoin transaction flows and entity behaviors.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Apache Spark
- Google Colab (for the provided notebook) or local Jupyter environment
- Sufficient storage space for blockchain data

### Dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pyspark
pip install PyDrive
pip install wget
pip install pyvis
pip install streamlit
pip install networkx
pip install matplotlib
```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VincenzoImp/Bitcoin-Address-Clustering.git
cd Bitcoin-Address-Clustering
```

2. Configure Spark context with appropriate memory settings:
```python
conf = SparkConf()\
    .set('spark.executor.memory', '50G')\
    .set('spark.driver.memory', '50G')\
    .set('spark.driver.maxResultSize', '50G')\
    .set("spark.driver.cores", "10")\
    .set("spark.sql.analyzer.maxIterations", "100000")
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Set Global Constants**:
```python
start_block = 0
end_block = 115000
```

2. **Download Dataset**:
```python
v_path, e_path, a_path, d_path = download_dataset(start_block, end_block, DATA_DIR, spark, True)
```

3. **Generate Transaction Graph**:
```python
nx_graph = generate_nx_graph(v_df, e_df, graph_path, start_block, end_block, True)
```

4. **Apply Clustering Algorithm**:
```python
clustered_addresses = address_clustering(nx_graph, a_df, known_tx_df, spark, start_block, debug=True)
```

### Web Application

Launch the interactive web interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py 0 115000
```

## Methodology

The project follows a systematic approach:

1. **Data Collection**: Extract transaction data from Bitcoin blockchain via Blockchain.info API
2. **Graph Construction**: Build directed graphs with transactions as nodes and UTXOs as edges
3. **Heuristic Application**: Apply multiple clustering heuristics in sequence
4. **Result Analysis**: Evaluate clustering effectiveness and entity reduction
5. **Visualization**: Generate interactive graphs for cluster exploration

## Heuristics Implemented

### Simple Heuristics

1. **Satoshi Heuristic**: Groups addresses from early coinbase transactions (blocks < 19,500) as likely belonging to Satoshi Nakamoto

2. **Coinbase Transaction Mining Address Clustering**: Assumes all output addresses from coinbase transactions belong to the same miner

3. **Common-Input-Ownership**: Groups all input addresses in multi-input transactions as belonging to the same entity

4. **Single Input/Output**: Treats single input, single output transactions as address movements within the same entity

5. **Consolidation Transaction**: Groups addresses in transactions with multiple inputs and single output

### Advanced Heuristics

6. **Payment Transaction Analysis**: Identifies payment transactions with change addresses

7. **Change Address Detection**: Uses multiple sub-heuristics:
   - Same address in input and output
   - Address reuse patterns
   - Unnecessary input analysis
   - New address identification
   - Round number detection

8. **Mixed Transaction Recognition**: Identifies and handles CoinJoin transactions using taint analysis

## Results

### Clustering Effectiveness

- **Initial Addresses**: ~1,000,000 unique addresses
- **After Clustering**: ~550,000 entities (45% reduction)
- **With Small Cluster Assumption**: ~220,000 entities (78% reduction)

### Entity Distribution

The clustering reveals a power-law distribution of entity sizes:
- Most entities contain 1-2 addresses
- Few large entities contain hundreds of addresses
- Largest clusters likely represent exchanges or major services

## Web Application

The project includes a Streamlit-based web interface that allows users to:

- Input Bitcoin addresses for clustering analysis
- Visualize transaction graphs with cluster highlighting
- Explore entity relationships and transaction flows
- Download clustering results and statistics

### Features:
- Interactive network visualization using PyVis
- Real-time address clustering
- Detailed transaction information
- Export capabilities

## Use Cases

### 1. Entity Movement Visualization
Track how funds move between addresses belonging to the same entity:

```python
address = '115uADbwcLhfKeWJzy7EHjSWjn3dpHK1vZ'
cluster_graph = visualize_entity_movements(address)
```

### 2. Chain Analysis Queries
Answer specific questions about blockchain activity:

- "How many unique miners were active before 2011?"
- "What's the largest entity by address count?"
- "Which entities show mixing behavior?"

### 3. Research Applications
- Academic research on Bitcoin privacy
- Compliance and AML investigations
- Cryptocurrency forensics
- Network analysis studies

## Data Sources

- **Blockchain Data**: Blockchain.info API
- **Block Range**: Genesis block (0) to block 115,000
- **Time Period**: January 2009 to February 2011
- **Transactions**: ~400,000 transactions analyzed

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Requirements**: 50GB+ RAM recommended for full dataset
- **Processing Time**: Several hours for complete clustering
- **Storage**: ~10GB for preprocessed datasets
- **Scalability**: Designed for distributed processing with Spark

## Limitations

- **Privacy Techniques**: Advanced privacy methods (CoinJoin, mixers) can reduce clustering effectiveness
- **False Positives**: Heuristics may incorrectly group unrelated addresses
- **Temporal Scope**: Analysis limited to early Bitcoin history (2009-2011)
- **Data Availability**: Depends on external API availability
